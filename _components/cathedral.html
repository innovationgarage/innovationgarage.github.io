description: |
  Replica of Tromsoâ€™s Arctic Cathedral with leds and wifi
  capabilities. Has 11 columns of lights and runs a real recording of
  an aurora. The final purpose of the project is to replicate the
  local sky in Tromso in realtime anywhere in the world, but this part
  has not been implemented yet.
