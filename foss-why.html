        <h1>Why Open Source?</h1>

        <p class="fw-500">We publish many of our components and
        libraries
        as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Open
        Source / Free Software</a>
        on <a href="https://github.com/innovationgarage">GitHub</a>.
        That means that you can use them in your own projects under
        certain conditions described in the license file accompanying
        the respective project. Why do we do this?</p>

        <p><em>Flexibility</em> - by publishing the code for you to
        use in your projects we can support many more use cases than
        by simply providing a single commercial product. Together we
        can build business opportunities around the code neither of us
        would have had, had we not shared the code.</p>

        <p><em>Auditability</em> - by publishing the code you can
        inspect our code to ensure that it does what we said it would
        do - in great detail.</p>

        <p><em>Quality improvement</em> - by letting you not only
        report problems in our software, but inspect the software for
        the source of the errors as well as potentially fix them
        yourself we can greatly improve the quality of the
        software.</p>
