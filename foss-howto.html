        <h1>How to use our code</h1>

        <p class="fw-500">We publish many of our components and
        libraries
        as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Open
        Source / Free Software</a>
        on <a href="https://github.com/innovationgarage">GitHub</a>.
        That means that you can use them in your own projects (under
        certain conditions described in the license file accompanying
        the respective project)!</p>

        <p>All components and libraries come with a README that at the
        very least describes how to compile / install the software and
        how to make a minimal use of it. In some cases a full
        reference manual is provided. Regardless, the software is
        provided as-is and there are no warranties as to
          functionality.</p>

        <p>To start using our code, simply clone the git repo, check
        the LICENSE file to make sure the terms are compatible with
        your intended use and then follow the instructions in the
        README file.</p>

        <p>You are welcome to report any bugs in the github issue
        tracker for each component or library, and we will do our best
        to look into the issue. However, note that this software is
        not included in any of our support contracts.</p>
