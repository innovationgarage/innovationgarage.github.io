### [TFPrism](https://innovationgarage.github.io/tfprism/)
TFPrism is a library that transforms your tensorflow graph to automatically do data parallelism for training. All you need to do to modify your single-cpu tensorflow code to run on a cluster is to send your training op and feed_dict through the library.

### [label-V](https://innovationgarage.github.io/label-V)
A semi-automatic video labeling tool. Label-V uses the multi-tracking algorithm in OpenCV to generate training data for your computer vision project.

### [Scramble](https://github.com/innovationgarage/Scramble)
