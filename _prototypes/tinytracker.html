  TinyTracker is a device that can be used to relay
  AIS messages from a ship, including its own
  position, speed etc to land using its regular
  (satellite) internet connection, giving land based
  personell the same view available on the on-board
  ECDIS.

<ul>
  <li>Same data about own ships that can be bought from Marinetraffic, but cheaper</li>
  <li>“ECDIS”-like on shore view of ships nearby own ships</li>
  <br />
  <li>Installation requires read-only access to NMEA bus on the bridge, and network connectivity with two ports on a specific IP open.</li>
  <li>Main risk: The device does not deliver any data to land, for whatever reason.</li>
  <li>The longer we can test, and on the more diverse ship routes, the better.</li>
</ul>
