  The drowning warning system will be able to detect excessive pitch
  and roll of a smaller fishing vessel and warn on shore personell.
---

<p>The drowning warning prototype is a box that measures and records
accelleration and rotation/tilting. This allow us to build up a
picture of how the boatd has behaved in the sea over time and compare
this with weather data for the area and time.</p>

<p>We have so far had the prototype installed on two vessels of a
single sport fishing camp, NAME OF CAMP, over a period of a few days,
capturing two separate fishing trips.<br>

<h2>Our vision / logn term goal</h2>

<p>We would like to build a dashboard to be used on shore that shows the
status of the boats that are out, and that issues warnings for the
bloats that are experiencing too rough weather conditions.</p>

<h2>What you can do to help us</h2>
  
<p>To achieve this we will need to build up a model of how boats of
different designs and sizes behave in different weather conditions and
situations. To do that, we need your help!</p>

<p>What we need help with is collecting data from your boats during
normal operation by installing our prototype box on them, recharging
the box battery and copying data from the SD-card of the box.</p>
