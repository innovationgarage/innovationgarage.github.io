          <p class="lead mt-5 mb-6 fw-500">The Innovation Garage builds early product prototypes, some
          of which will turn into Dualog products in the future. To
          validate both our ideas and implementations, we need testers.
          Are you quick to adopt new technologies into your business?<br />
          - Then our early adoptersâ€™ program is for you!</p>
          <p class="lead text-left mt-5 mb-6 fw-500">
            What we offer
            <ul class="text-left mt-5 mb-6 fw-500">
              <li>New prototypes for testing</li>
              <li>We will make sure the prototypes do not affect your
              other systems negatively in any way</li>
              <li>Our developers will be very interested in solving &
              figuring any problems with the prototype and will
              communicate directly with your staff.</li>
              <li>However, we can not make any guarantees what so ever
              that the prototype will actually work... After all, it is a
              prototype, not a product</li>
              <li>However, being an early adopter gives you the unique
              opportunity to influence or even define the future of
              new products and/or services.</li>
            </ul>
